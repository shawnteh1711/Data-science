#Hypothesis testing: 2-sample T test

#1 A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference 
#in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. 
#A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? 
#Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. 
#Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity 
#of the assumptions.

#####normality test######
#Ho: data are normal
#Ha: data are non-normal
shapiro.test(Unit.A)
# p-value = 0.32 > 0.05, so p high null fly => data follow normal distribution
shapiro.test(Unit.B)
# p-value = 0.52 > 0.05, so p high null fly => data follow normal distribution

#####variance test#####
#Ho: Variance are same
#Ha: variance are diferent
var.test(Unit.A,Unit.B)
# p-value = 0.31 > 0.05 so p high null fly => Equal variance

#####2-sample T test #####
#Ho: Average diameter are same
#Ha: Average diameter are different
t.test(Unit.A, Unit.B, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE)
# p-value = 0.47 > 0.05, so p high null fly => Average diameter are same
