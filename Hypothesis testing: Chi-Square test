Find if male-female buyer rations are similar across regions.

######Chi-Square test######
#Ho: male-female buyer rations are similar across regions
#Ha: male-female buyer rations are different across regions
chisq.test(data_1)   
# p-value = 0.66 > 0.05, so p high null fly => male-female buyer rations are similar 
#across regions
