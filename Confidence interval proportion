#set5 Confidence interval proportion
#5. According to Money, 60% of men have significant balding by age 50.
#If this finding is based on a random sample of 1,000 men of age 50, 
#give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of men of 50 who show some balding.

#Confidence interval proportion = pÌ Â± z *â((p Ì(1-p Ì))/n) 


conf <- 0.95 #confidence level
p_value <- (1 - conf)/2
z <- qnorm(p_value, lower.tail = FALSE)
prop <- 0.6
n <- 1000
error <- z * sqrt((prop*(1-prop))/(n))
lower <- prop - error
upper <- prop + error
