3Confidence interval

#4.	A survey of 5,250 business travelers worldwide conducted by OAG Business Travel Lifestyle 
#indicated that 91% of business travelers consider legroom the most important in-flight feature. 
#(Angle of seat recline and food service were second and third, respectively.) 
#Give a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all business travelers
#who consider legroom the most important feature.

conf <- 0.95 #confidence level
p_value <- (1 - conf)/2 #p-value
z <- qnorm(p_value, lower.tail = FALSE) #z-score
prop <- 0.91 #proportion
n <- 5250 #sample size
error <- z * sqrt((prop*(1-prop))/(n)) #error
lower <- prop - error #upper interval
upper <- prop + error #lower interval
